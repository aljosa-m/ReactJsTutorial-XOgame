### XO Game

I followed the official tutorial prepared by ReactJs team in order to create an XO game.

```
create-react-app xogame
```
There are three components:
Square
Board
Game

The Square component renders a single <button>, the Board renders 9 squares, and the Game component renders a board with various information (who plays next, who won, etc.).

The game has been deployed to Heroku, https://xoxo-game.herokuapp.com/
